homebrew-sdr
============

Homebrew formulas for software defined radio.

How do I install these formulas?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap dholm/homebrew-sdr` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you
can `brew install dholm/homebrew-sdr/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dholm/homebrew-sdr/master/<formula>.rb
```

Many of these formulas depend on GNU Radio from
[metacollin/homebrew-gnuradio](https://github.com/metacollin/homebrew-gnuradio).


Third Party Taps
================

* Pothos [pothosware/homebrew-pothos](https://github.com/pothosware/homebrew-pothos)

  ```
  brew tap pothosware/pothos
  ```
